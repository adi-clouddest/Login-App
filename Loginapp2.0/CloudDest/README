Purpose:
This app is created to be able to login and store the faces and signatures of employees of Cloud Destinations and make sure the user can access their offices with ease.

Softwares used:
React Native
Node js

Languages coded in:
Java Script

Running the code:
nmp install
npm start
scan the Qr code with your phone and make sure Expo go is downloaded

Shortcommings:
Tried using multiple face req files and none would work well with upscaling
Now I have the code for the app just the facial req is not good becasue each API i used would not scale correctly and ultimately I had to quit because of school.
