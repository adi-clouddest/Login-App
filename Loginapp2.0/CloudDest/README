Purpose:
This app is created to be able to login and store the faces and signatures of employees of Cloud Destinations and make sure the user can access their offices with ease.

Softwares used:
React Native
Node js

Languages coded in:
Java Script

Running the code:
nmp install
npm start
scan the Qr code with your phone and make sure Expo go is downloaded

Current status: 
App will connect with the users phone and can take photos that will save on users device.

Shortcommings:
Tried using multiple face req files and none would work well with upscaling
Now I have the code for the app just the facial req is not good becasue each API i used would not scale correctly and ultimately I had to quit because of school.

Face-api : Needs the pictures to be all online which wont work with a database
Face-recognition.js : Will only work if predetermined amount of files and is old and outdated/ wouldnt work on my system
